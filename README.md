Problem Statement

The necessity to monitor the homeless has been the bigger issue facing society today. Given that they are a vital component of the community, it is imperative that they receive the care they need. Additionally, it is quite challenging to keep track of the homeless because their information is frequently dispersed. Manual data collecting is time-consuming and may lead to poor judgment. Therefore, it is crucial to keep track of each homeless person who is currently living on the streets, as well as the actions taken to save them.

Proposal

The suggested system is created to gather data over time on the traits and support requirements of all men, women, and kids who are experiencing homelessness. Its main goal is to accurately assess the problem's size and the efficacy of measures taken to address the issue of homelessness in individuals. It gives us a chance to make it easier for homeless people to better access that are being provided.
